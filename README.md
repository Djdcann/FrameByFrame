# Project Overview
The Frame By Frame project intends to collect all of the frame data from the video game Super Smash Bros. Melee into a well structured database and use that data to do a visual analysis in a web application. Frame data consists of things like startup lag, end lag, and hit frames on attacks as well as invincibility frames and startup frames for defensive options. An extensive API for accessing the frame data will be put in place so it can be easily retrieved and used in practical applications in and outside of the web application itself. The Frame By Frame web application will be programmed to display a higher level frame data analysis for each character and each character matchup (one character vs. another). With the database of frame data, Frame By Frame will be able to determine what attacks are actually possible to perform and what the best decisions are in certain situations.
